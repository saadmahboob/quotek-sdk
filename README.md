Quotek Algo-trading SDK v2.2
============================

Quotek SDK is a C++ programming toolkit that aims to help traders and finance engineers to code
efficient strategies in a fast and easy way.

Built arround the recent C++11 programming concepts, Quotek is blazing fast but also remains trivial to use. Quotek SDK is also

Features
========

The goal behind Quotek SDK is to offer the maximum number of useful functions to the IT Quants. Beyond them you can find:

- Quantitative analysis functions.
- Stochastic calculus processes.
- Machine learning algorithms and API Bindings (Alchemy API..).
- Quotes historical data and newsfeed fetchers ( Yahoo Finance, RSS Feeds..).

The following scheme summurizes all the features which are already available in the SDK:
